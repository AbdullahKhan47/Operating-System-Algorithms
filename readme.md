# First Come First Serve

In this number of process will be input and those process will be executed according the concept of FCFS. The burst and arrival time of the process will be input from the user, and after the execution of the process the output which will be obtained will be the waiting time, average waiting time and response time.


# Shortest Remaining Time First

In this number of process will be input and those process will be executed according the concept of SRTF. The burst and arrival time of the process will be input from the user, and after the execution of the process the output which will be obtained will be the waiting time, average waiting time and turnaround time, completion time.


# Round Robin (FCFS)

In this number of process will be input and those process will be executed according the concept of RR (FCFS). The burst and arrival time of the process will be input from the user, and after the execution of the process the output which will be obtained will be the waiting time, average waiting time and turnaround time. 

# Banker Algorithm

This is an Algorithm which is used to avoid deadlock situation while handling the process and allocating resources to the process. This program execute according to the concepts of the banker algorithm.  The number of process, types of resources, number of resource for every type, allocated resources for each process, number of requested resources for each process and initial available resources are taken as input and according to the situation. After the execution of the program the output which will be obtained will be in the form of sequence that how process where executed according to the banker algorithm.
